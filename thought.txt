you have a check for distributing the wine casks evenly -- that is, that there
is enough to be divdided evenly

but shouldn't there be an algorithm to determine -- ahead of time -- what those
ammounts should look like
eg. 3 Full, 2 Empty, 4 Empty -- abut that amount would need to be flexible,
since I know 00 fro experience,only after having doing it -- that not everyone
won't get that amount....


Right now, I am letteing the program figure out the amounts through for loop
iteration and if/else.... just seems sloppy


0000

can you get the total and make that once using
then multiply that method by the number of people

in other words, get the exact amount of casks of ea type that are needed to make
the wineAmountOwed, Once -- then multiple those casks used to 


Accumulate the type of each casks -- meaning find the total of ea

get wine totals
Full  : 7 x 1.0 = 7.0
Half  : 7 x 0.5 = 3.5
Empty : 7 x 0.0 = 0.0


Total = 10.5


get Amount owed
wineType * wineType.value +
wineType * wineType.value /
numOfPeople

(7 + (7 * 0.5)) / 3 = 3.5
